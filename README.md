# Alternance_Dative

## Description

      This project is to create models in R for predicting the dative alternation in english, 
    for studying on these subjects:

    1. Is the result of prediction changed when we change parameter `interlocutor` in model?   
    2. Is the result of prediction changed when we change lexical parameters (theme length, recipient length) in model?
    3. Is the result of prediction changed when we change training data (written and oral versions) in model?
